== encoding

ENTRY: <T>[<TARG>]<PAYLOAD>
PAYLOAD: [<SIZE>][<DATA>]

// storage type
<T>: 
  size: 1 byte
  values of most significated four bits:
  data   description
    0 -  N null value           no targ  no size  no data
    1 -  H half byte value      no targ  no size  no data  // data persists in four least significated bits
    2 -  1 byte value           no targ  no size  1 byte
    3 -  2 byte value           no targ  no size  2 bytes
    4 -  4 byte value           no targ  no size  4 bytes
    5 -  8 byte value           no targ  no size  8 bytes
    6 - 16 byte value           no targ  no size  16 bytes
    7 -  B blob value           no targ  size     count of bytes in size
    8 -  S structure of values  targ     size     count of bytes in size
    9 -  L list of values       no targ  size     count of bytes in size

// size of DATA-section
<SIZE>: <Type from [1-16]><1-16 bytes depend on type>
<DATA>: <some count of bytes>

// structure

S<TARG><SIZE><ENTRY>+
// integer type id of structure declaration in schema
<TARG>:  <Type from [1-16]><1-16 bytes depend on type>

//for each field <ENTRY> was written in order described in scheme, 
//  empty field with null writed as 0x00 (null value)
//  union written as single field with generic type (union of defferent fields with identical type is not supported)
//  

// list

// list without type contains full <ENTRY> for each element
L0<SIZE><ENTRY>+
// list with type contains only <PAYLOAD> section of each 
//   element data (because T<TARG> defined in list <TARG> section)
L<TARG><SIZE><PAYLOAD>+
// type of list elements
<TARG>: <T><TARG>

== schema

xml based schema conatins:

- common properties like byte order, persists formats (for example encoding of negative int values) and etc
- define logic types and map it to storage types
- define structures

supported logic types:
 - int, negative values as described in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two's_complement
   attrs: signed\unsigned, 
   map to: 1-16 bytes
 - float,  IEEE 754
   map to: 1-16 bytes
 - datetime, utc value in ms from epoch
   map to: 8 bytes
 - string, utf-8 string (note, without 0x00 byte at end)
   attrs: maxSize 
   map to: B
 - bytes
   attrs: maxSize
   map to: B
 - boolean: 
   map to: H
 - list:
   attrs: type, maxSize
   map to: L
 - structure:
   attrs: id, mappedTypeName
   map to: S
